        you prefer. If you want us to change the way we contact you, please let

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          for clinical audit, to assess and improve our service. We routinely
          audit all aspects of the donation process, for example to check that
          the Donor Safety Check forms are completed properly, and that
          interviews with our healthcare professionals are conducted in
          accordance with the guidelines. Results of audits are always presented
          with all donor identities removed.
        </li>
        <li>
          for research, to improve our knowledge about the donor population. By
          looking at the sorts of people who become active donors, we can
          understand better how to meet their expectations of us, and identify
          opportunities for recruiting and retaining more donors. This is
          essential to help us to collect adequate supplies of all types of
          blood.
        </li>
        <li>
          For management and administration, for example to help us to plan
          where and when to hold collection sessions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Whenever personal identifiers are not needed for these tasks, if
        possible we remove them from the information we use.
      </p>
      {/* <p>
        All information about you and your donations is stored securely in our
        systems to ensure that we have a complete record of your donations. We
        also keep the Donor Safety Check forms you complete every time you
        attend to donate. We are required by law (The Blood Safety and Quality
        Regulations 2005) to keep donor and donation information for a minimum
        of 30 years.
      </p> */}
      <p>
        It is very important to us to keep your address and contact details up
        to date, so that we are able to stay in touch. To do this we may compare
        the details we hold with central NBB records or those of other
        organisations that offer approved services for checking and updating
        addresses.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we are an NBB organisation, we may use peopleâ€™s NBB numbers to help
        us ensure correct identification and to find and remove duplicate
        records on our systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than for keeping our own records up to date against central
        records, we do not allow any other organisation to access the donor
        base.
      </p>
      <p>We do not give or sell donor details to any third parties.</p>
      <h2>Website Usage:</h2>
      <p>
        We automatically track certain anonymous information about all our
        website users based on what you do on the site. We use this information
        to analyse our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour on the site
        to understand and serve you better. We do not use this data to identify
        an individual.
      </p>
      <h2>Our responsibilities:</h2>
      <p>
        We are committed to maintaining the security and confidentiality of your
        donor record. We actively implement security measures to ensure your
        information is safe, and audit these regularly. All our staff and anyone
        who receives information from us have a legal duty to keep information
        about you confidential.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will not release your personal details to any third party without
        first seeking your consent, unless this is allowed for or required by
        law.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are constantly working to ensure compliance with current data
        protection legislation.
      </p>
      <h2>Your rights:</h2>
      <p>
        Data protection legislation gives you, the donor, various rights. The
        most important of these are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You have the right to a copy of information we hold about you.</li>
        <li>
          You have the right to ask for your record to be amended if you believe
          that it is wrong.
        </li>

        <li>
          You have the right to be forgotten. You can request to be removed from
          the Service if you have yet to make a donation or provided any medical
          information.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
