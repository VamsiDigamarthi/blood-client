      </p>
      <h2>5. Lawful basis for processing your personal data</h2>
      <p>
        Paragraph 7 of Chapter 2 to the Data Protection Act 2018 says that, as a
        government body, NBB may process personal data as necessary for the
        effective performance of a task carried out in the public interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        NBB also has obligations under the Blood Safety & Quality Regulations
        2005, Tissue and Cells Quality and Safety Regulations 2007 and Organ
        Quality and Safety Regulations 2012, to make sure that all blood
        donations and organ transplants are fully traceable from donor to
        recipient.
      </p>
      <p>This is an essential requirement to deliver safe clinical care.</p>
      <p>
        This may affect your individual rights, in particular your right to
        erasure and to be forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is because NBB must keep all clinical records for 30 years if you
        donate to ensure traceability in line with the regulations listed above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where required, NBB will also satisfy the common law duty of
        confidentiality, and will define a lawful basis for the use of
        disclosure of the personal information that has been provided in
        confidence, this can include; valid informed consent; determining an
        overriding public interest or where there is a statutory basis or legal
        duty to disclose.
      </p>

      <h2>13. National Data Opt Out</h2>
      <p>
        Our organisation is compliant with the national data opt-out policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever you use a health or care service or using any of our services,
        important information about you is collected in a patient record for
        that service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collecting this information helps to ensure you get the best possible
        care and treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The information collected about you when you use these services can also
        be used and provided to other organisations for purposes beyond your
        individual care, for instance to help with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>improving the quality and standards of care provided</li>
        <li>research into the development of new treatments </li>
        <li>preventing illness and diseases</li>
        <li>monitoring safety</li>
        <li>planning services</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most of the time, anonymised data is used for research and planning so
        that you cannot be identified in which case your confidential patient
        information is not needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have a choice about whether you want your confidential patient
        information to be used in this way. If you are happy with this use of
        information you do not need to do anything. If you do choose to opt-out
        your confidential patient information will still be used to support your
        individual care.
      </p>
      <p>Find out more or register your choice to opt-out.</p>
      <p>
        You can find out more about how patient information is used for health
        and care research.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also find out more about how and why patient information is
        used, the safeguards and how decisions are made.
      </p>
      <p>You can change your mind about your choice at any time.</p>
      <p>
        Data being used or shared for purposes beyond individual care does not
        include your data being shared with insurance companies or used for
        marketing purposes and data would only be used in this way with your
        specific agreement.
